## Features

The set of tools provided by _dotpi_ run both on a server and on each Raspberry Pi. In short, _dotpi_ provides:

- A way to configure and install the system on the Raspberry Pi, e.g. sound card, network
- Some services and daemons, e.g. ensure that the audio and the network always runs
- Some command line tools, e.g. to install and remove a service
- A manager to deploy, run and monitor your projects on a fleet of Raspberry Pis
